# CandleSticks

1. I implemented this code on swift 5 and xcode 13.4.1.
2. I implemented the three symbols with their corresponding graphs. The graphs can expand and shrink. can scroll left and left (if the graph is fully appearing it will not scroll. so you have to zoom in so you can scroll left and right).
3. I used this repo https://github.com/danielgindi/Charts to get the charts.
4. The problem with this repo is that it has an issue considering the candle stick. it always reproduce one candle and this issues hasn't been solved from their side yet. but i looked for the issues in their repo and found someone solved it and opened a PR, so i took the whole repo locally in my project and added the fix in this PR so now i have the candle stick with the right chart.
5. The task almost took between 4 to 6 Hrs.
6. The error handling and loading state has been implemented.
