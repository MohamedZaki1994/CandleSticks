# CandleSticks

1. I implemented this code on swift 5 and xcode 13.4.1.
2. I used this repo https://github.com/danielgindi/Charts to get the charts.
3. The problem With this repo is that it has an issue considering the candle stick. it always reproduce one candle and this issues hasn't been solved from their side yet. but i look for the issues in their repo and found someone solved it and opened a PR, so i took the whole repo locally in my project and added the fix in this PR so now i have the candle stick with the right chart.
4.The task almost took between 4 to 6 Hrs
